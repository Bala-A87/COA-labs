# Labs for CS2610 Computer Organization and Architecture

The following are the assignments done as part of the lab:
1. An assembly program to find the number of and sum of a sequence of numbers taken as input
2. An assembly program to encrypt a string input on the basis of given guidelines
3. An assembly program to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function">Ackermann function</a> recursively
4. A high-level language program to determine the cache block size and associativity of the machine's L1$
5. Implementing cache-oblivious matrix multiplication in a high-level language and comparing its performance with the naive algorithm
6. Implementing a hybrid/adaptive DRAM row buffer management policy in a high-level language with the help of <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/jwac12/">USIMM simulator</a>
7. An assembly program using system calls for file access and modification, as well as mmap and fork
8. Implement a simple scalar pipelined processor in a high-level language

Assignments 4, 6, 7, 8 were team assignments and were done by <a href="https://github.com/chathur018">Chathur B</a> and myself.
