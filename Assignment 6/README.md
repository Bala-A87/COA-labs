# Note:

This code is not meant to be run or understood as an independent piece of code. It is meant to be used as a substitute for the <b>scheduler.c</b> file that is present by default in the USIMM simulator. The same can be downloaded from the following link: <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/jwac12/">USIMM simulator</a>

Instructions to compile and run the code as part of the simulator can be obtained from the simulator's README.
